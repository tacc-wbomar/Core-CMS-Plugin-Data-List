## Important

These are only sample stylesheets. Your app should use CSS suitable to your app.

## Notes

The `c-` prefix of this class is a [namespace](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/) for a component in [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/).

The distinction of [`structure` and `skin` is from OOCSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/#separation-of-structure-from-skin).
